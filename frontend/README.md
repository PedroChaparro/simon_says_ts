# Simon Says

## Run

You can open `./dist/index.html` on `dist` branch (**Live server extension / Any other implementation of web server is required due to ESModules**), otherwise, run the following commands:

Compile with tsc (NodeJS is required):

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
tsc
```

Then, open `./dist/index.html` file.
